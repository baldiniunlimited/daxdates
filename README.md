# Date logic for DAX

This repo holds sample templates and implementations for time intelligence and
other date logic in Microsoft's BI suite, including Power BI, Power Pivot, Power
Query, and SSAS Tabular.

## PQ DimDate

[PQ DimDate](PQ%20DimDate.pbix) holds a date dimension generated entirely in M
script and forms a basis for most useful time intelligence patterns in DAX.

Note: there is a WIP branch for handling alternative start months for fiscal calendars. It is not ready for prime-time, but you can see the current state [here](https://github.com/baldiniunlimited/daxdates/tree/handle-fiscal-start-month).
